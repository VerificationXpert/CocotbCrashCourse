# Cocotb Crash Course

Welcome to the Cocotb Crash Course repository! This repository is designed to provide you with a quick and comprehensive introduction to Cocotb - a Python-based coroutine library for verifying digital designs.

## What is Cocotb?

Cocotb stands for Coroutine-based Cosimulation TestBench. It enables testbenches to be written in Python, which can interact directly with HDL (Hardware Description Language) simulators. Cocotb allows you to write testbenches in a high-level language, leveraging Python's simplicity and power, while still interfacing with the low-level hardware description.

## About this Repository

In this repository, you will find a series of tutorials and examples aimed at helping you get started with Cocotb quickly. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced user seeking advanced techniques, this crash course has something for everyone.
